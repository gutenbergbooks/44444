<div class="small">

<p>We were shown a beautiful specimen of the ingenuity of birds, a
few days since, by Dr. Cook, of this borough. It was a birdsnest
made entirely of silver wires, beautifully woven together. The
nest was found on a sycamore tree, on the Condorus, by Dr. Francis
Beard, of York county. It was the nest of a hanging-bird; and the
material was probably obtained from a soldier&rsquo;s epaulet, which it had
found.</p>

<span class="i2">The sailor stout and bold,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">To countries new and old.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tom was a man of thousands; he<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Might toss him up and down.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Amid the waters dark and deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He had the happy art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all around was storm, to keep<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fair weather in his heart.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though winds were wild, and waves were rough,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He &rsquo;d always cast about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And find within he &rsquo;d calm enough<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To stand the storms without.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;For naught,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;is ever gained<br /></span>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;And sure I am, the worst of storms,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That any man should dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is that, which in the bosom forms,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And musters to the head.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Serene, and ever self-possessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His mess-mates he would cheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often put their fears to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When dangers gathered near.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If on the rocks the ship was cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And surges swept the deck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tom Tar was ever found the last,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who would forsake the wreck.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And when his only hat and shoes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The waters plucked from him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, these, he felt, were small to lose,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Could he keep up and swim!<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then through the billows, foam, and spray,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That rose on every hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He &rsquo;d, somehow, always find a way<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of getting safe to land.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The secret was, the fear and love<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of Heaven had filled his soul:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His trust was firm in One above,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Howe&rsquo;er the seas might roll.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And Tom had sailed to many a shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And many a wonder seen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stories he could tell would more<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than fill a magazine.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He &rsquo;d seen mankind in every state,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Almost, that man can know;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Nor scorned the poor and low.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The monarch in his sight had stood,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">In skins and feathers dressed.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">In lands remote from ours.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He &rsquo;d seen the wide-winged albatross<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her breast in ocean lave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bold sea-lions, playing, toss<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their heads above the wave.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He &rsquo;d seen the dolphin, while his back<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Went flashing to the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A swarm of flying fish attack,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And swallow every one!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The porpoise and the spouting whale<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And ever, when Tom Tar got home,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And greet them by the way.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, oft, some curious stone, or shell,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The laughing girls and boys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would find, that on their aprons fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To put among their toys.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">&ldquo;These pearly shells,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I found<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mounts to her glorious home!<br /></span>
<span class="i22">&rsquo;T was she, who bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first grand offering of the free, on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When to the shore, through Egypt&rsquo;s solemn sea,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The franchised Hebrews passed with feet dry-shod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pæans gave to their Deliverer there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She cheered the wanderers on; and when they crossed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over old Jordan, to the strong-armed foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still she was with them; and her single breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid the proud Painim&rsquo;s city-walls in dust!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In native light, she walked Judea&rsquo;s hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sipped the dew of Hermon from its flower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the Sun of righteousness arose.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Prophet chose her to unseal his lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere God spake through them; and the Prophetess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lift the heart&rsquo;s pure gift from her&rsquo;s to Heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When Israel&rsquo;s king was troubled, her soft hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put close, but gently, to his gloomy breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reached the dark spirit there, and laid it still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound by the chords a shepherd minstrel swept.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since, her countless thousands she has brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To heaven&rsquo;s mild kingdom, happy captives led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By those sweet glowing strings of David&rsquo;s lyre.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But oh! her richest, dearest notes to man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In strains aerial over Bethlehem poured,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When <span class="smcap">He</span>, whose brightness is the light of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To earth descending for a mortal&rsquo;s form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid by his glory, save one radiant mark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That moved through space, and o&rsquo;er the infant hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He summoned Music to attend him here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Announcing peace below!<br /></span>
<span class="i22">He called her, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sweeten that sad supper, and to twine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her mantle round him, and his few, grieved friends<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To join their mournful spirits with the hymn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere to the Mount of Olives he went out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sorrowful.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">And now, his blessed word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sacred pledge, is left to dying man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then at his second coming in his power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Music shall still be with him; and her voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sound through the tombs and wake the dead to life!<br /></span>
